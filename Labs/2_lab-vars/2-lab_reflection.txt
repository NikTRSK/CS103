To accomplish this we would specify a while loop that uses the following condition: number >= 10. In the loop we would take the mod 10 of the number and then divide the number by 10. We would print out the digit. After the loop we would print out the value of the last division (/).

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int number, digit;
   
   cout << "Enter a number between 0 and 999: ";
   cin >> number;
   
   while (number >= 10)
   {
	   digit = number % 10;
	   number = number / 10;
	   
	   cout << digit << endl;
   }
   
   cout << number;
   return 0;
}
